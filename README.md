Pixelator
=========

This program is a simple tool to make any picture look pixelated.
You will be asked 4 prompts upon start:

	image name (must be the same folder or total path must be given)
	the pixel size, this declares how pixelated the picture will look in the end
	it calculates the mean color of a cluster the size of the pixelsize²
	the output name of the file (keep in mind every picture will be saved in PNG)
	scale (if you do not wish an up or downscale just type in 100)
